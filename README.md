# DNATree Implements a form of search tree that handles DNA Sequences. DNA Sequences are inserted into the tree by using different subtrees based on the position of the letter in the sequence. Tree handles insertions, deletions, and searches in the tree. It is also able to print the percentage of a letter in the sequence as well as the lengths of the sequences.
